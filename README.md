What is web scraping:

Web scraping is a process extracting information from a website using code.

In this initiative we will attempt to extract information using python and some of the libraries known for web scraping called requests and beautiful soup.

Following are the steps on how to extract the information:

-Import the libraries needed for the project
-Download the page using requests
-Parse the html source code using BeautifulSoup
-Extract the information and the data that we are trying to about the movies
-Extract and combine data from multiple pages from the portal
-Compile extracted information into python data objects
-Finally, write and save the info into CSV files
 By the end of this project we will have the information about movies in a certain period into files

This is the information we will gather about the movies:

* Movie Title
* Releasing year
* IMDB Rating
* Movie rating,
* Movie duration
* Movie Genre
* Metascore,
* Votes
